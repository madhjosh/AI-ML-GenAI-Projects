## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🚀 Agentic RAG-based Smart Nutrition Disorder Specialist
A domain-specific **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** assistant built using **LangChain**, **Chroma**, **OpenAI LLMs**, and **Streamlit**, tailored for dietary/nutrition-related Q&A.

### 🧠 LoRA Fine-Tuning on Domain Data
Trained a base **LLaMA 2 model** on domain-specific texts using **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** for lightweight fine-tuning. Includes evaluation and deployment scripts.

### 📊 ML Project: Customer Churn Prediction
An end-to-end pipeline for **supervised ML** using structured data. Covers feature engineering, model tuning (**Random Forest**, **XGBoost**), and deployment on **Azure**.

### 🎨 Image Classification with CNNs
Built deep learning **image classifiers** using **PyTorch** on real-world image datasets. Includes **confusion matrix** analysis and **Grad-CAM** visualization.

### 💬 RAG + LangGraph Experiment
Explored **LangGraph-based RAG pipelines** for knowledge graph construction and retrieval, with **GenAI output orchestration**.
