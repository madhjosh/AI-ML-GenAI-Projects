/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<p>As a Gen AI Data Scientist at InnoviTech Solutions, the objective is to develop an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based system tailored for the Global Nutrition Health Organization. This system is designed to support users by streamlining the extraction and integration of vital nutritional information from extensive resources, such as the Nutritional Medical Reference.</p>
<p>The application aims to enable healthcare providers to quickly access information regarding symptoms, diagnoses, treatment plans, and more, thereby reducing the need for lengthy manual searches. The RAG-based chatbot will be built with a custom advanced workflow that includes the following key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Query Expansion:</strong> Enhancing user queries to improve retrieval accuracy without altering the original intent. This step ensures that the user's queries are refined to capture the most relevant information from the extensive nutritional resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Context Retrieval:</strong> Fetching relevant documents from a vector store based on the expanded or original query. This step is crucial to provide contextually relevant information that the model can use to generate accurate responses.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Response Generation:</strong> Crafting accurate and informative responses strictly adhering to the retrieved context. This ensures that the AI provides information directly from the trusted nutritional sources, maintaining reliability and relevance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Groundedness Evaluation:</strong> Assessing the factual alignment of the generated response with the retrieved context. This step ensures that the responses generated by the AI are factually correct and based on the provided context, enhancing the credibility of the information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Precision Evaluation:</strong> Scoring the precision of the response in addressing the user's query. This step evaluates how well the response addresses the specific query of the user, ensuring relevance and usefulness.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Response Refinement:</strong> Providing constructive feedback to improve gaps, ambiguities, or missing details in the response. If the response does not meet the groundedness or precision criteria, it is refined to ensure it meets the required standards.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Query Refinement:</strong> Suggesting improvements for the expanded query to enhance search precision. If the response needs further improvement, the query itself is refined to ensure better retrieval in subsequent iterations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these operations is to ensure that the AI provides the best possible response from the context provided, strictly adhering to the nutritional disorder manuals. By performing these operations, we ensure that the responses are both accurate and relevant, meeting the high standards expected in healthcare.</p>
<p>The workflow diagram, included below, visually represents this advanced workflow, highlighting the iterative process of grounding, precision checking, and refinement to achieve the most accurate and useful responses:</p>

<p>In this section, we lay the groundwork for the AI Nutrition Disorder Specialist bot by meticulously parsing and preparing data from various nutritional disorder documents. We begin by installing and importing the necessary libraries, followed by unzipping the documents and setting up configurations for OpenAI models. Next, we parse PDF content using LlamaParse to extract tables and validate parsed JSON objects. We then perform semantic chunking of text for structured retrieval, and generate hypothetical questions and metadata for these text chunks and tables. Finally, we store everything in ChromaDB, ensuring efficient retrieval and processing of relevant information for the bot's responses. This structured approach equips the AI with the ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries related to nutritional disorders.</p>

Nutrition: General Considerations\n Introduction\n Nutrition is the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrients are chemicals in foods that are\n used by the body for growth, maintenance, and energy. Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body\n and thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some\n amino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds,\n although they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are\n required by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\n Lack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p.\n 9). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56) and related disorders; excess intake of\n micro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much\n usaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.\n Macronutrients\n Macronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients.\n Carbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids),\n macrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as\n sources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g).\n Carbohydrates: Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides.\n Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, supplying energy. Simple carbohydrates are composed of\n small molecules, generally monosaccharides or disaccharides, which increase blood glucose levels\n rapidly. Complex carbohydrates are composed of larger molecules, which are broken down into\n monosaccharides. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels more slowly but for a longer\n time. Glucose and sucrose are simple carbohydrates; starches and fiber are complex carbohydrates.\n The glycemic index measures how rapidly consumption of a carbohydrate increases plasma glucose\n levels. Values range from 1 (the slowest increase) to 100 (the fastest increase, equivalent to pure glucose\n \u2014see\n Table 1-1). However, the actual rate of increase also depends on what foods are consumed with the\n carbohydrate.\n Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index may increase plasma glucose to high levels rapidly. It is\n hypothesized that, as a result, insulin levels increase, inducing hypoglycemia and hunger, which tends to\n lead to consumption of excess calories and weight gain. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index\n increase plasma glucose levels slowly, resulting in lower postprandial insulin levels and less hunger,\n which probably makes consumption of excess calories less likely. These effects are predicted to result in\n a more favorable lipid profile and a decreased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and complications of\n diabetes if present.\n Proteins: Dietary proteins are broken down into peptides and amino acids. Proteins are required for\n tissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth. However, if the body is not getting enough\n calories from dietary sources or tissue stores (particularly of fat), protein may be used for energy.\n As the body uses dietary protein for tissue production, there is a net gain of protein (positive nitrogen\n balance). During catabolic\n [Table 1-1. Glycemic Index of Some Foods]\n states (eg, starvation, infections, burns), more protein may be used (because body tissues are broken\n down) than is absorbed, resulting in a net loss of protein (negative nitrogen balance).

Macronutrients are required by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\n\nLack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p. 9). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56) and related disorders; excess intake of micronutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much unsaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.",

Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes* for Some Macronutrients, Food and Nutrition\n Board, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies]\n Micronutrients\n Vitamins and minerals required in minute amounts (trace minerals) are micronutrients (see Chs. 4 and 5).\n Water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and 8 members of the vitamin B complex: biotin,\n folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin (vitamin B1), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and\n vitamin B12 (cobalamin).\n Fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A (retinol), D (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol), E (\u03b1-tocopherol), and\n K (phylloquinone and menaquinone).\n Only vitamins A, E, and B12 are stored to any significant extent in the body; the other vitamins must be\n consumed regularly to maintain tissue health.\n Essential trace minerals include chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,\n and zinc. Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\n metabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\n developed countries (see Ch. 5).\n Other minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\n proved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\n compound with Ca (CaF2), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\n All trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\n Other Dietary Substances\n The daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\n these, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\n useful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the\n production and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\n many other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\n Fiber: Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility,\n prevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\n of cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\n suggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\n patients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\n (present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\n glucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\n The typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\n flour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\n more vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\n fiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\n Nutritional Requirements\n Good nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\n and mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\n weight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical\n activity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\n than needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year. If energy intake is less than expenditure,\n weight is lost.\n                                                                                                        55",

Nutrition: General Considerations\n Evaluating general nutritional status includes history, physical examination, and sometimes tests. If\n undernutrition is suspected, laboratory tests (eg, albumin levels) and skin tests for delayed\n hypersensitivity may be done (see p.\n 13). Body composition analysis (eg, skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis) is used to\n estimate percentage of body fat and to evaluate obesity (see p. 58).\n History includes questions about dietary intake, weight change, and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies\n and a focused review of systems (see\n Table 2-1 on p. 11). A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\n eaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\n eaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is\n the most accurate record.\n A complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body\n fat, should be done. Body mass index (BMI)\u2014weight(kg)/height(m)2, which adjusts weight for height (see\n Table 6-2 on p. 59), is more accurate than height and weight tables. There are standards for growth and\n weight gain in infants, children, and adolescents (see p. 2756).\n Distribution of body fat is important. Disproportionate truncal obesity (ie, waist/hip ratio &gt; 0.8) is\n associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus more\n often than fat located elsewhere. Measuring waist circumference in patients with a BMI of &lt; 35 helps\n determine whether they have truncal obesity and helps predict risk of diabetes, hypertension,\n hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disorders. Risk is increased if waist circumference is &gt; 102 cm\n (&gt; 40 in) in men or &gt; 88 cm (&gt; 35 in) in women.\n Nutrient-Drug Interactions\n Nutrition can affect the body's response to drugs; conversely, drugs can affect the body's nutrition.\n Foods can enhance, delay, or decrease drug absorption. Foods impair absorption of many antibiotics.\n They can alter metabolism of drugs; eg, high-protein diets can accelerate metabolism of certain drugs by\n stimulating cytochrome P-450. Eating grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P-450 34A, slowing metabolism of\n some drugs (eg, amiodarone, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, certain Ca channel blockers). Diets that alter\n the bacterial flora may markedly affect the overall metabolism of certain drugs. Some foods affect the\n body's response to drugs. For example, tyramine, a component of cheese and a potent vasoconstrictor,\n can cause hypertensive crisis in some patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and eat cheese.\n Nutritional deficiencies can affect drug absorption and metabolism. Severe energy and protein\n deficiencies reduce enzyme tissue concentrations and may impair the response to drugs by reducing\n absorption or protein binding and causing liver dysfunction. Changes in the GI tract can impair absorption\n and affect the response to a drug. Deficiency of Ca, Mg, or zinc may impair drug metabolism. Vitamin C\n deficiency decreases activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially in the elderly.\n Many drugs affect appetite, food absorption, and tissue metabolism (see\n Table 1-6). Some drugs (eg, metoclopramide) increase GI motility, decreasing food absorption. Other\n drugs (eg, opioids, anticholinergics) decrease GI motility. Some drugs are better tolerated if taken with\n food.\n Certain drugs affect mineral metabolism. For example, diuretics, especially thiazides, and corticosteroids\n can deplete body K, increasing susceptibility to digoxin-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated use of\n laxatives may deplete K. Cortisol, desoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone cause marked Na and water\n retention, at least temporarily; retention is much less with prednisone, prednisolone, and some other\n corticosteroid analogs. Sulfonylureas and lithium can impair the uptake or release of iodine by the thyroid.\n Oral contraceptives can lower blood zinc levels and increase copper levels. Certain antibiotics (eg,\n tetracyclines) reduce iron absorption, as can certain foods (eg, vegetables, tea, bran).\n Certain drugs affect vitamin absorption or metabolism.

Undernutrition\n Introduction\n Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition\u2014see Ch. 6).\n Undernutrition can result from inadequate ingestion of nutrients, malabsorption, impaired\n metabolism, loss of nutrients due to diarrhea, or increased nutritional requirements (as occurs\n in cancer or infection). Undernutrition progresses in stages; each stage usually takes\n considerable time to develop. First, nutrient levels in blood and tissues change, followed by\n intracellular changes in biochemical functions and structure. Ultimately, symptoms and signs\n appear.\n Risk Factors\n Undernutrition is associated with many disorders and circumstances, including poverty and social\n deprivation. Risk is also greater at certain times (ie, during infancy, early childhood, adolescence,\n pregnancy, breastfeeding, and old age).\n Infancy and childhood: Infants and children are particularly susceptible to undernutrition because of\n their high demand for energy and essential nutrients. Because vitamin K does not readily cross the\n placenta, neonates may be deficient, so all are given a single injection of vitamin K within 1 h of birth to\n prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a life-threatening disorder (see pp. 46 and\n 2783). Infants fed only breast milk, which is typically low in vitamin D, are given supplemental vitamin D;\n they can develop vitamin B12 deficiency if the mother is a vegan. Inadequately fed infants and children\n are at risk of protein-energy undernutrition (PEU\u2014previously called protein-energy malnutrition) and\n deficiencies of iron, folate (folic acid), vitamins A and C, copper, and zinc. During adolescence, nutritional\n requirements increase because the growth rate accelerates. Anorexia nervosa (see p. 1535) may affect\n adolescent girls in particular.\n Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Requirements for nutrients increase during pregnancy and\n breastfeeding. Aberrations of diet, including pica (consumption of nonnutritive substances, such as clay\n and charcoal), may occur during pregnancy. Anemia due to iron deficiency is common, as is anemia due\n to folate deficiency, especially among women who have taken oral contraceptives. Vitamin D deficiency is\n common during late pregnancy, predisposing the child to decreased bone mass.\n Old age: Aging\u2014even when disease or dietary deficiency is absent\u2014leads to sarcopenia (progressive\n loss of lean body mass), starting after age 40 and eventually amounting to a muscle loss of about 10 kg\n (22 lb) in men and 5 kg (11 lb) in women. Undernutrition contributes to sarcopenia, and sarcopenia\n accounts for many of the complications of undernutrition (eg, decreased nitrogen balance, increased\n susceptibility to infections). Causes of sarcopenia include the following:\n \u2022 Decreased physical activity\n \u2022 Decreased food intake\n \u2022 Increased levels of cytokines (particularly interleukin-6)\n \u2022 Decreased levels of growth hormone and mechano growth factor (insulin-like growth factor-3)\n \u2022 In men, decreasing androgen levels\n Aging decreases basal metabolic rate (due mainly to decreased fat-free mass), total body weight, height,\n and skeletal mass; aging increases mean body fat (as a percentage of body weight) to about 30% (from\n 20%) in men and to 40% (from 27%) in women.\n From age 20 to 80, food intake decreases, especially in men. Anorexia due to aging itself has many\n causes, including reduced adaptive relaxation of the stomach's fundus, increased release and activity of\n                                                                                                      59",

Alcoholism can cause deficiencies of Mg, zinc, and certain vitamins, including thiamin.",
                    "md": "Cholecystokinin (which produces satiation), and increased leptin (an anorectic hormone produced by fat cells). Diminished taste and smell can decrease eating pleasure but usually decrease food intake only slightly. Anorexia may have other causes (eg, loneliness, inability to shop or prepare meals, dementia, some chronic disorders, use of certain drugs). Depression is a common cause. Occasionally, anorexia nervosa (sometimes called anorexia tardive in the elderly), paranoia, or mania interferes with eating. Dental problems limit the ability to chew and subsequently to digest foods. Swallowing difficulties (eg, due to strokes, other neurologic disorders, esophageal candidiasis, or xerostomia) are common. Poverty or functional impairment limits access to nutrients.\n\nThe institutionalized elderly are at particular risk of PEU. They are often confused and may be unable to express hunger or preferences for foods. They may be physically unable to feed themselves. Chewing or swallowing may be very slow, making it tedious for another person to feed them enough food.\n\nIn the elderly, particularly the institutionalized elderly, inadequate intake and often decreased absorption or synthesis of vitamin D, increased demand for vitamin D, and inadequate exposure to sunshine contribute to osteomalacia (see p. 41).\n\nDisorders and medical procedures: Diabetes, some chronic disorders that affect the GI tract, intestinal resection, and certain other GI surgical procedures tend to impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin B12, Ca, and iron. Gluten enteropathy, pancreatic insufficiency, or other disorders can result in malabsorption. Decreased absorption possibly contributes to iron deficiency and osteoporosis. Liver disorders impair storage of vitamins A and B12 and interfere with metabolism of protein and energy sources. Renal insufficiency predisposes to protein, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies. Anorexia causes some patients with cancer or depression and many with AIDS to consume inadequate amounts of food. Infections, trauma, hyperthyroidism, extensive burns, and prolonged fever increase metabolic demands. Any condition that increases cytokines may be accompanied by muscle loss, lipolysis, low albumin levels, and anorexia.\n\nVegetarian diets: Iron deficiency can occur in ovo-lacto vegetarians (although such a diet can be compatible with good health). Vegans may develop vitamin B12 deficiency unless they consume yeast extracts or Asian-style fermented foods. Their intake of Ca, iron, and zinc also tends to be low. A fruit-only diet is not recommended because it is deficient in protein, Na, and many micronutrients.\n\nFad diets: Some fad diets result in vitamin, mineral, and protein deficiencies; cardiac, renal, and metabolic disorders; and sometimes death. Very low calorie diets (&amp;lt; 400 kcal/day) cannot sustain health for long.\n\nDrugs and nutritional supplements: Many drugs (eg, appetite suppressants, digoxin) decrease appetite; others impair nutrient absorption or metabolism. Some drugs (eg, stimulants) have catabolic effects. Certain drugs can impair absorption of many nutrients; eg, anticonvulsants can impair absorption of vitamins.\n\nAlcohol or drug dependency: Patients with alcohol or drug dependency may neglect their nutritional needs. Absorption and metabolism of nutrients may also be impaired. IV drug addicts typically become undernourished, as do alcoholics who consume \u2265 1 quart of hard liquor/day. Alcoholism can cause deficiencies of Mg, zinc, and certain vitamins, including thiamin.",

Undernutrition\n Diagnosis is based on results of medical and diet histories, physical examination, body composition\n analysis (see p. 58), and selected laboratory tests.\n History: History should include questions about dietary intake (see\n Fig. 2-1), recent changes in weight, and risk factors for undernutrition, including drug and alcohol use.\n Unintentional loss of \u2265 10% of usual body weight during a 3-mo period indicates a high probability of\n undernutrition. Social history should include questions about whether money is available for food and\n whether the patient can shop and cook.\n Review of systems should focus on symptoms of nutritional deficiencies (see Table 2-1). For example,\n impaired night vision may indicate vitamin A deficiency.\n Physical examination: Physical examination should include measurement of height and weight,\n inspection of body fat distribution, and anthropometric measurements of lean body mass. Body mass\n index (BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)2) adjusts weight for height (see\n Table 6-2 on p. 59). If weight is &lt; 80% of what is predicted for the patient's height or if BMI is \u2264 18,\n undernutrition should be suspected. Although these findings are useful in diagnosing undernutrition and\n are acceptably sensitive, they lack specificity.\n [Fig. 2-1. Mini nutritional assessment.]\n The mid upper arm muscle area estimates lean body mass. This area is derived from the triceps skinfold\n thickness (TSF) and mid upper arm circumference. Both are measured at the same site, with the patient's\n right arm in a relaxed position. The average mid upper arm circumference is about 32 \u00b1 5 cm for men and\n 28 \u00b1 6 cm for women. The formula for calculating the mid upper arm muscle area in cm2 is as follows:\n (midarm circumference (cm) (3.14X TSF cm)]\"  10 (males) or  6.5 (temales)\n This formula corrects the upper arm area for fat and bone. Average values for the mid upper arm muscle\n area are 54 \u00b1 11 cm2 for men and 30 \u00b1 7 cm2 for women. A value &lt; 75% of this standard (depending on\n age) indicates depletion of lean body mass (see\n Table 2-2). This measurement may be affected by physical activity, genetic factors, and age-related\n muscle loss.\n Physical examination should focus on signs of specific nutritional deficiencies. Signs of PEU (eg, edema,\n muscle wasting, skin changes) should be sought. Examination should also focus on signs of conditions\n that could predispose to nutritional deficiencies, such as dental problems. Mental status should be\n assessed, because depression and cognitive impairment can lead to weight loss.\n The widely used Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) uses information from the patient history (eg,\n weight loss, change in intake, GI symptoms), physical examination findings (eg, loss of muscle and\n subcutaneous fat, edema, ascites), and the clinician's judgment of the patient's nutritional status. The\n Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) has been validated and is widely used, especially for elderly patients\n (see Fig. 2-1). The Simplified Nutrition Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ), a simple, validated method of\n predicting future weight loss, may be used (see\n Fig. 2-2).\n Testing: The extent of laboratory testing needed is unclear and may depend on the patient's\n circumstances. If the cause is obvious and correctable (eg, a wilderness survival situation), testing is\n probably of little benefit. Other patients may require more detailed evaluation.\n Serum albumin measurement is the laboratory test most often used. Decreases in albumin and other\n proteins (eg, prealbumin [transthyretin], transferrin, retinol-binding protein) may indicate protein deficiency\n or PEU. As undernutrition progresses, albumin decreases slowly; prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-\n binding protein decrease rapidly.

Kwashiorkor may also\n result from an acute illness, often gastroenteritis or another infection (probably secondary to cytokine\n release), in a child who already has PEU.

Factors contributing to cardiac cachexia may include passive hepatic congestion (causing\n   anorexia), edema of the intestinal tract (impairing absorption), and, in advanced disease, increased O2\n   requirement due to anaerobic metabolism.

Undernutrition\n Stool cultures should be obtained and checked for ova and parasites if diarrhea is severe or does not\n resolve with treatment. Sometimes urinalysis, urine culture, blood cultures, tuberculin testing, and a chest\n x-ray are used to diagnose occult infections because people with PEU may have a muted response to\n infections.\n Prognosis\n Children: In children, mortality varies from 5 to 40%. Mortality rates are lower in children with mild PEU\n and those given intensive care. Death in the first days of treatment is usually due to electrolyte deficits,\n sepsis, hypothermia, or heart failure. Impaired consciousness, jaundice, petechiae, hyponatremia, and\n persistent diarrhea are ominous signs. Resolution of apathy, edema, and anorexia is a favorable sign.\n Recovery is more rapid in kwashiorkor than in marasmus.\n Long-term effects of PEU in children are not fully documented. Some children develop chronic\n malabsorption and pancreatic insufficiency. In very young children, mild intellectual disability may develop\n and persist until at least school age. Permanent cognitive impairment may occur, depending on the\n duration, severity, and age at onset of PEU.\n Adults: In adults, PEU can result in morbidity and mortality (eg, progressive weight loss increases\n mortality rate for elderly patients in nursing homes). In elderly patients, PEU increases the risk of\n morbidity and mortality due to surgery, infections, or other disorders. Except when organ failure occurs,\n treatment is uniformly successful.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Usually, oral feeding\n \u2022 Possibly avoidance of lactose (eg, if persistent diarrhea suggests lactose intolerance)\n \u2022 Supportive care (eg, environmental changes, assistance with feeding, orexigenic drugs)\n \u2022 For children, feeding delayed 24 to 48 h\n Worldwide, the most important preventive strategy is to reduce poverty and improve nutritional education\n and public health measures.\n Mild or moderate PEU, including brief starvation, can be treated by providing a balanced diet, preferably\n orally. Liquid oral food supplements (usually lactose-free) can be used when solid food cannot be\n adequately ingested. Diarrhea often complicates oral feeding because starvation makes the GI tract more\n likely to move bacteria into Peyer's patches, facilitating infectious diarrhea. If diarrhea persists\n (suggesting lactose intolerance), yogurt-based rather than milk-based formulas are given because people\n with lactose intolerance can tolerate yogurt. Patients should also be given a multivitamin supplement.\n Severe PEU or prolonged starvation requires treatment in a hospital with a controlled diet. The first\n priority is to correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (see Ch. 97) and treat infections. Next is to supply\n macronutrients orally or, if necessary (eg, when swallowing is difficult), through a feeding tube, a\n nasogastric tube (usually), or a gastrostomy tube. Parenteral nutrition is indicated if malabsorption is\n severe (see p. 23).\n Other treatments may be needed to correct specific deficiencies, which may become evident as weight\n increases. To avoid deficiencies, patients should take micronutrients at about twice the recommended\n daily allowance (RDA) until recovery is complete.\n Children: Underlying disorders should be treated. For children with diarrhea, feeding may be delayed 24\n to 48 h to avoid making the diarrhea worse; during this interval, children require oral or IV rehydration.\n Feedings are given often (6 to 12 times/day) but, to avoid overwhelming the limited intestinal absorptive\n capacity, are limited to small amounts (&lt; 100 mL). During the first week, milk-based formulas with\n supplements added are usually given in progressively increasing amounts; after a week, the full amounts\n                                                                                                         65",

Sometimes urinalysis, urine culture, blood cultures, tuberculin testing, and a chest x-ray are used to diagnose occult infections because people with PEU may have a muted response to infections.\n\n# Prognosis\n\n# Children:\n\nIn children, mortality varies from 5 to 40%. Mortality rates are lower in children with mild PEU and those given intensive care. Death in the first days of treatment is usually due to electrolyte deficits, sepsis, hypothermia, or heart failure.

Twice the RDA of micronutrients should be given,\n using commercial multivitamin supplements. After 4 wk, the formula can be replaced with whole milk plus\n cod liver oil and solid foods, including eggs, fruit, meats, and yeast.\n Energy distribution among macronutrients should be about 16% protein, 50% fat, and 34% carbohydrate.\n An example is a combination of powdered cow's skimmed milk (110 g), sucrose (100 g), vegetable oil (70\n g), and water (900 mL). Many other formulas (eg, whole [full-fat] fresh milk plus corn oil and maltodextrin)\n can be used. Milk powders used in formulas are diluted with water.\n Usually, supplements should be added to formulas:\n \u2022 Mg 0.4 mEq/kg/day IM is given for 7 days.\n \u2022 B-complex vitamins at twice the RDA are given parenterally for the first 3 days, usually with vitamin A,\n   phosphorus, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, fluoride, molybdenum, and selenium.\n \u2022 Because absorption of oral iron is poor in children with PEU, oral or IM iron supplementation may be\n   necessary.\n Parents are taught about nutritional requirements.\n Adults: Underlying disorders should be treated. For example, if AIDS or cancer results in excess cytokine\n production, megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone may improve food intake. However, because\n these drugs dramatically decrease testosterone in men (possibly causing muscle loss), testosterone\n should be replaced. Because these drugs can cause adrenal insufficiency, they should be used only\n short-term (&lt; 3 mo).\n In patients with functional limitations, home delivery of meals and feeding assistance are key.\n An orexigenic drug, such as the cannabis extract dronabinol, should be given to patients with anorexia\n when no cause is obvious or to patients at the end of life when anorexia impairs quality of life. An\n anabolic steroid (eg, enanthate, nandrolone, testosterone) or growth hormone can benefit patients with\n cachexia due to renal failure and possibly elderly patients (eg, by increasing lean body mass or possibly\n by improving function).\n Correction of PEU in adults generally resembles that in children; feedings are often limited to small\n amounts. However, for most adults, feeding does not need to be delayed. A commercial formula for oral\n feeding can be used.

Nutritional Support\n Introduction\n Many undernourished patients need nutritional support, which aims to increase lean body mass. Oral\n feeding can be difficult for some patients with anorexia or with eating or absorption problems. Behavioral\n measures that sometimes enhance oral intake include the following:\n \u2022 Encouraging patients to eat\n \u2022 Heating or seasoning foods\n \u2022 Providing favorite or strongly flavored foods\n \u2022 Encouraging patients to eat small portions\n \u2022 Scheduling around meals\n \u2022 Assisting patients with feeding\n If behavioral measures are ineffective, nutritional support\u2014oral, enteral tube, or parenteral nutrition\u2014is\n indicated, except sometimes for dying or severely demented patients (see p. 25).\n Predicting Nutritional Requirements\n Nutritional requirements are predicted so that interventions can be planned. Requirements can be\n estimated by formulas or measured by indirect calorimetry. Indirect calorimetry requires use of a metabolic\n cart (a closed rebreathing system that determines energy expenditure based on total CO2 production),\n which requires special expertise and is not always available. Thus, total energy expenditure (TEE) and\n protein requirements usually are estimated.\n Energy expenditure: TEE varies based on the patient's weight, activity level, and degree of metabolic\n stress (metabolic demands); TEE ranges from 25 kcal/kg/day for people who are sedentary and not under\n stress to about 40 kcal/kg/day for people who are critically ill. TEE equals the sum of\n \u2022 Resting metabolic rate (RMR, or resting energy expenditure rate), which is normally about 70% of TEE\n \u2022 Energy dissipated by metabolism of food (10% of TEE)\n \u2022 Energy expended during physical activity (20% of TEE)\n Undernutrition can decrease RMR up to 20%. Conditions that increase metabolic stress (eg, critical\n illness, infection, inflammation, trauma, surgery) can increase RMR but rarely by &gt; 50%.\n The Mifflin-St. Jeor equation estimates RMR more precisely and with fewer errors than the commonly\n used Harris-Benedict equation, usually providing results that are within 20% of those measured by\n indirect calorimetry. The Mifflin-St. Jeor equation estimates RMR as follows:\n   Men: kcal / day = 66 + (13.7 \u00d7 wt[kg]) + (5 \u00d7 height[cm]) - (6.8 \u00d7 age)\n Women: kcal / day = 665 + (9.6 \u00d7 wt[kg]) + (1.8 \u00d7 height[cm]) - (4.7 \u00d7 age)\n TEE can be estimated by adding about 10% (for sedentary people) to about 40% (for people who are\n critically ill) to RMR.\n Protein requirements: For healthy people, protein requirements are estimated at 0.8 g/kg/day.\n However, for patients with metabolic stress or kidney failure and for elderly patients, requirements may be\n higher (see\n                                                                                                        69",

If TPN is given outside the hospital, patients must be taught to recognize symptoms of infection, and qualified home nursing must be arranged.\n\nThe solution is started slowly at 50% of the calculated requirements, using 5% dextrose to make up the balance of fluid requirements. Energy and nitrogen should be given simultaneously. The amount of regular insulin given (added directly to the TPN solution) depends on the plasma glucose level; if the level is normal and the final solution contains 25% dextrose, the usual starting dose is 5 to 10 units of regular insulin/L of TPN fluid.",

Because many people eat irregularly, foods alone may provide suboptimal amounts of some vitamins. In these cases, the risk of certain cancers or other disorders may be increased. Because of this risk, routine daily multivitamin supplements are sometimes recommended.",
                    "md": "Vitamins may be fat soluble (vitamins A, D, E, and K) or water soluble (B vitamins and vitamin C). The B vitamins include biotin, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (B2), thiamin (B1), B6 (eg, pyridoxine), and B12 (cobalamins). For dietary requirements, sources, functions, effects of deficiencies and toxicities, blood levels, and usual therapeutic dosages for vitamins, see Tables 4-1 and 4-2.\n\nDietary requirements for vitamins (and other nutrients) are expressed as daily recommended intake (DRI). There are 3 types of DRI:\n\n- Recommended daily allowance (RDA): RDAs are set to meet the needs of 97 to 98% of healthy people.\n- Adequate intake (AI): When data to calculate an RDA are insufficient, AIs are based on observed or experimentally determined estimates of nutrient intake by healthy people.\n- Tolerable upper intake level (UL): ULs are the largest amount of a nutrient that most adults can ingest daily without risk of adverse health effects.\n\nIn developed countries, vitamin deficiencies result mainly from poverty, food faddism, drugs (see p. 7 and Table 4-3), alcoholism, or prolonged and inadequately supplemented parenteral feeding. Mild vitamin deficiency is common among frail and institutionalized elderly people who have protein-energy undernutrition. In developing countries, deficiencies can result from lack of access to nutrients.\n\nDeficiencies of water-soluble vitamins (except vitamin B12) may develop after weeks to months of undernutrition. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and of vitamin B12 take &amp;gt; 1 yr to develop because the body stores them in relatively large amounts. Intake of vitamins sufficient to prevent classic vitamin deficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi) may not be adequate for optimum health. This area remains one of controversy and active research.\n\nVitamin dependency results from a genetic defect involving metabolism of a vitamin. In some cases, vitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin toxicity (hypervitaminosis) usually results from taking megadoses of vitamin A, D, C, B6, or niacin. Because many people eat irregularly, foods alone may provide suboptimal amounts of some vitamins. In these cases, the risk of certain cancers or other disorders may be increased.

The normal requirement is 400 \u03bcg/day.\n [Table 4-4. Causes of Folate Deficiency]\n (CAUTION: In patients with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before\n treating with folate. If vitamin B12 deficiency is present, folate supplementation can alleviate the\n anemia but does not reverse and may even worsen neurologic deficits.) For pregnant women, the\n recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 600 \u03bcg/day. For women who have had a fetus or infant with a\n neural tube defect, the recommended dose is 1000 to 5000 \u03bcg/day.\n Niacin\n Niacin (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide) derivatives include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and\n nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are coenzymes in oxidation-reduction\n reactions. They are vital in cell metabolism. Because dietary tryptophan can be metabolized to niacin,\n foods rich in tryptophan (eg, dairy products) can compensate for inadequate dietary niacin.\n Niacin Deficiency\n Dietary niacin deficiency (causing pellagra) is uncommon in developed countries. Clinical\n manifestations include the \"three Ds\": localized pigmented rash (dermatitis); gastroenteritis\n (diarrhea); and widespread neurologic deficits, including cognitive decline (dementia).\n Diagnosis is usually clinical, and dietary supplementation (oral or, if needed, IM) is usually\n successful.\n Etiology\n Primary deficiency results from extremely inadequate intake of both niacin and tryptophan, which usually\n occurs in areas where maize (Indian corn) constitutes a substantial part of the diet. Bound niacin, found in\n maize, is not assimilated in the GI tract unless it has been previously treated with alkali, as when tortillas\n are prepared. Corn protein is also deficient in tryptophan. The high incidence of pellagra in India among\n people who eat millet with a high leucine content has led to the hypothesis that amino acid imbalance may\n contribute to deficiency. Deficiencies of protein and many B vitamins commonly accompany primary niacin\n deficiency.\n Secondary deficiency may be due to diarrhea, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. Pellagra also may occur in\n carcinoid syndrome (tryptophan is diverted to form 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin) and in Hartnup\n disease (absorption of tryptophan by the intestine and kidneys is defective).\n Symptoms and Signs\n Pellagra is characterized by skin, mucous membrane, CNS, and GI symptoms. Advanced pellagra can\n cause a symmetric photosensitive rash, stomatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental aberrations. Symptoms\n may appear alone or in combination.\n Skin symptoms include several types of lesions, which are usually bilaterally symmetric. The distribution\n of lesions\u2014at pressure points or sun-exposed skin\u2014is more pathognomonic than the form of the lesions.\n Lesions can develop in a glovelike distribution on the hands (pellagrous glove) or in a boot-shaped\n                                                                                                      78",

It may\n be more intense after alcohol ingestion, aerobic activity, sun exposure, and consumption of spicy foods.\n Flushing is minimized if niacin is taken after meals or if aspirin (325 mg) is taken 30 to 45 min before\n niacin. The chance of severe flushing can be reduced by starting immediate-release niacin at a low dose\n (eg, 50 mg tid) and increasing it very slowly. At intermediate doses (1000 mg/day), triglyceride levels\n decrease 15 to 20%, and HDL cholesterol levels increase 15 to 30%. Reductions in LDL cholesterol are\n modest (&lt; 10%). Higher doses of niacin (3000 mg/day) reduce LDL cholesterol 15 to 20% but may cause\n jaundice, abdominal discomfort, blurred vision, worsening of hyperglycemia, and precipitation of\n preexisting gout.

Diagnosis is usually clinical.\n Treatment consists of oral or, if needed, IM riboflavin.\n Primary riboflavin deficiency results from inadequate intake of fortified cereals, milk, and other animal\n products. The most common causes of secondary deficiency are chronic diarrhea, malabsorption\n syndromes, liver disorders, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, long-term use of barbiturates, and chronic\n alcoholism.\n Symptoms and Signs\n The most common signs are pallor and maceration of the mucosa at the angles of the mouth (angular\n stomatitis) and vermilion surfaces of the lips (cheilosis), eventually replaced by superficial linear fissures.\n The fissures can become infected with Candida albicans, causing grayish white lesions (perleche). The\n tongue may appear magenta. Seborrheic dermatitis develops, usually affecting the nasolabial folds, ears,\n eyelids, and scrotum or labia majora. These areas become red, scaly, and greasy.\n Rarely, neovascularization and keratitis of the cornea occur, causing lacrimation and photophobia.\n Diagnosis\n The lesions characteristic of riboflavin deficiency are nonspecific. Riboflavin deficiency should be\n suspected if characteristic signs develop in a patient with other B vitamin deficiencies. Diagnosis can be\n confirmed by a therapeutic trial or laboratory testing, usually by measuring urinary excretion of riboflavin.\n Treatment\n Riboflavin 5 to 10 mg/day po is given until recovery. Other water-soluble vitamins should also be given.\n Thiamin\n Thiamin (vitamin B1) is widely available in the diet. Thiamin is involved in carbohydrate, fat, amino acid,\n glucose, and alcohol metabolism. Thiamin is essentially nontoxic.\n Thiamin Deficiency\n Thiamin deficiency (causing beriberi) is most common among people subsisting on white rice\n or highly refined carbohydrates in developing countries and among alcoholics. Symptoms\n include diffuse polyneuropathy, high-output heart failure, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n Thiamin is given to help diagnose and treat the deficiency.\n Etiology\n Primary thiamin deficiency is caused by inadequate intake of thiamin. It is commonly due to a diet of\n highly refined carbohydrates (eg, polished rice, white flour, white sugar). It also develops when intake of\n other nutrients is inadequate; it often occurs with other B vitamin deficiencies.\n                                                                                                      80",

In alcoholics, many mechanisms contribute to\n thiamin deficiency; they include decreased intake, impaired absorption and use, increased demand, and\n possibly an apoenzyme defect.\n Pathophysiology\n Deficiency causes degeneration of peripheral nerves, thalamus, mammillary bodies, and cerebellum.\n Cerebral blood flow is markedly reduced, and vascular resistance is increased.\n The heart may become dilated; muscle fibers become swollen, fragmented, and vacuolized, with\n interstitial spaces dilated by fluid. Vasodilation occurs and can result in edema in the feet and legs.\n Arteriovenous shunting of blood increases.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency &amp; Toxicity\n Electrolytes, including Mg, should be measured to exclude other causes. For confirmation in equivocal\n cases, erythrocyte transketolase activity and 24-h urinary thiamin excretion may be measured.\n Diagnosis of cardiovascular beriberi can be difficult if other disorders that cause heart failure are present.\n A therapeutic trial of thiamin can help.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Supplemental thiamin, with dose based on clinical manifestations\n Ensuring that dietary supplies of thiamin are adequate is important regardless of symptoms. Because IV\n glucose can worsen thiamin deficiency, alcoholics and others at risk of thiamin deficiency should receive\n IV thiamin 100 mg before receiving IV glucose solutions.\n For mild polyneuropathy, thiamin 10 to 20 mg po once/day is given for 2 wk. For moderate or advanced\n neuropathy, the dose is 20 to 30 mg/day; it should be continued for several weeks after symptoms\n disappear. For edema and congestion due to cardiovascular beriberi, thiamin 100 mg IV once/day is given\n for several days. Heart failure is also treated.\n For Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamin 50 to 100 mg IM or IV bid must usually be given for several\n days, followed by 10 to 20 mg once/day until a therapeutic response is obtained. Anaphylactic reactions\n to IV thiamin are rare. Symptoms of ophthalmoplegia may resolve in a day; improvement in patients with\n Korsakoff psychosis may take 1 to 3 mo. Recovery from neurologic deficits is often incomplete in\n Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and in other forms of thiamin deficiency.\n Because thiamin deficiency often occurs with other B vitamin deficiencies, multiple water-soluble vitamins\n are usually given for several weeks. Patients should continue to consume a nutritious diet, supplying 1 to\n 2 times the daily recommended intake of vitamins; all alcohol intake should stop.\n Vitamin A\n Vitamin A (retinol) is required for the formation of rhodopsin, a photoreceptor pigment in the retina. Vitamin\n A helps maintain epithelial tissues. Normally, the liver stores 80 to 90% of the body's vitamin A. To use\n vitamin A, the body releases it into the circulation bound to prealbumin (transthyretin) and retinol-binding\n protein. \u03b2-Carotene and other provitamin carotenoids, contained in green leafy and yellow vegetables\n and deep- or bright-colored fruits, are converted to vitamin A. Carotenoids are absorbed better from\n vegetables when they are cooked or homogenized and served with some fats or oils.\n Retinol activity equivalents (RAE) were developed because provitamin A carotenoids have less vitamin A\n activity than preformed vitamin A; 1 \u03bcg retinol = 3.33 IU.\n Synthetic vitamin analogs (retinoids) are being used increasingly in dermatology. The possible protective\n role of \u03b2-carotene, retinol, and retinoids against some epithelial cancers is under study. However, risk of\n certain cancers may be increased after \u03b2-carotene supplementation.\n Vitamin A Deficiency\n Vitamin A deficiency can result from inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or liver disorders.\n Deficiency impairs immunity and hematopoiesis and causes rashes and typical ocular effects\n (eg, xerophthalmia, night blindness). Diagnosis is based on typical ocular findings and low\n vitamin A levels. Treatment consists of vitamin A given orally or, if symptoms are severe or\n malabsorption is the cause, parenterally.\n Etiology\n Primary vitamin A deficiency is usually caused by prolonged dietary deprivation. It is endemic in areas\n such as southern and eastern Asia, where rice, devoid of \u03b2-carotene, is the staple food. Xerophthalmia\n due to primary deficiency is a common cause of blindness among young children in developing countries.\n                                                                                                        82",

            "text": "The Merck Manual of Diagnosis &amp; Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 4. Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency &amp; Toxicity\n Secondary vitamin A deficiency may be due to decreased bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids or to\n interference with absorption, storage, or transport of vitamin A. Interference with absorption or storage is\n likely in sprue, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, duodenal bypass, chronic diarrhea, bile duct\n obstruction, giardiasis, and cirrhosis. Vitamin A deficiency is common in prolonged protein-energy\n undernutrition not only because the diet is deficient but also because vitamin A storage and transport is\n defective. In children with complicated measles, vitamin A can shorten the duration of the disorder and\n reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of death.\n Symptoms and Signs\n Impaired dark adaptation of the eyes, which can lead to night blindness, is an early symptom.\n Xerophthalmia (which is nearly pathognomonic) results from keratinization of the eyes. It involves drying\n (xerosis) and thickening of the conjunctivae and corneas. Superficial foamy patches composed of\n epithelial debris and secretions on the exposed bulbar conjunctiva (Bitot's spots) develop. In advanced\n deficiency, the cornea becomes hazy and can develop erosions, which can lead to its destruction\n (keratomalacia).\n Keratinization of the skin and of the mucous membranes in the respiratory, GI, and urinary tracts can\n occur. Drying, scaling, and follicular thickening of the skin and respiratory infections can result. Immunity\n is generally impaired.\n The younger the patient, the more severe are the effects of vitamin A deficiency. Growth retardation and\n infections are common among children. Mortality rate can exceed 50% in children with severe vitamin A\n deficiency.\n Diagnosis\n \u2022 Serum retinol levels, clinical evaluation, and response to vitamin A\n Ocular findings suggest the diagnosis. Dark adaptation can be impaired in other disorders (eg, zinc\n deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, severe refractive errors, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy). If dark\n adaptation is impaired, rod scotometry and electroretinography are done to determine whether vitamin A\n deficiency is the cause.\n Serum levels of retinol are measured. Normal range is 28 to 86 \u03bcg/dL (1 to 3 \u03bcmol/L). However, levels\n decrease only after the deficiency is advanced because the liver contains large stores of vitamin A. Also,\n decreased levels may result from acute infection, which causes retinol-binding protein and transthyretin\n (also called prealbumin) levels to decrease transiently. A therapeutic trial of vitamin A may help confirm\n the diagnosis.\n Prevention\n The diet should include dark green leafy vegetables, deep- or bright-colored fruits (eg, papayas,\n oranges), carrots, and yellow vegetables (eg, squash, pumpkin).

            "md": "# The Merck Manual of Diagnosis &amp; Therapy, 19th Edition\n\n# Chapter 4. Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency &amp; Toxicity\n\nSecondary vitamin A deficiency may be due to decreased bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids or to interference with absorption, storage, or transport of vitamin A. Interference with absorption or storage is likely in sprue, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, duodenal bypass, chronic diarrhea, bile duct obstruction, giardiasis, and cirrhosis. Vitamin A deficiency is common in prolonged protein-energy undernutrition not only because the diet is deficient but also because vitamin A storage and transport is defective. In children with complicated measles, vitamin A can shorten the duration of the disorder and reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of death.\n\n# Symptoms and Signs\n\nImpaired dark adaptation of the eyes, which can lead to night blindness, is an early symptom. Xerophthalmia (which is nearly pathognomonic) results from keratinization of the eyes. It involves drying (xerosis) and thickening of the conjunctivae and corneas. Superficial foamy patches composed of epithelial debris and secretions on the exposed bulbar conjunctiva (Bitot's spots) develop. In advanced deficiency, the cornea becomes hazy and can develop erosions, which can lead to its destruction (keratomalacia).\n\nKeratinization of the skin and of the mucous membranes in the respiratory, GI, and urinary tracts can occur. Drying, scaling, and follicular thickening of the skin and respiratory infections can result. Immunity is generally impaired.\n\nThe younger the patient, the more severe are the effects of vitamin A deficiency. Growth retardation and infections are common among children. Mortality rate can exceed 50% in children with severe vitamin A deficiency.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n- Serum retinol levels, clinical evaluation, and response to vitamin A\n\nOcular findings suggest the diagnosis. Dark adaptation can be impaired in other disorders (eg, zinc deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, severe refractive errors, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy). If dark adaptation is impaired, rod scotometry and electroretinography are done to determine whether vitamin A deficiency is the cause.\n\nSerum levels of retinol are measured. Normal range is 28 to 86 \u03bcg/dL (1 to 3 \u03bcmol/L). However, levels decrease only after the deficiency is advanced because the liver contains large stores of vitamin A. Also, decreased levels may result from acute infection, which causes retinol-binding protein and transthyretin (also called prealbumin) levels to decrease transiently. A therapeutic trial of vitamin A may help confirm the diagnosis.\n\n# Prevention\n\nThe diet should include dark green leafy vegetables, deep- or bright-colored fruits (eg, papayas, oranges), carrots, and yellow vegetables (eg, squash, pumpkin). Vitamin A-fortified milk and cereals, liver, egg yolks, and fish liver oils are helpful. Carotenoids are absorbed better when consumed with some dietary fat.

The same doses are\n recommended for infants and children with complicated measles. Infants born of HIV-positive mothers\n should receive 50,000 IU (15,000 RAE) within 48 h of birth. Prolonged daily administration of large doses,\n especially to infants, must be avoided because toxicity may result.\n For pregnant or breastfeeding women, prophylactic or therapeutic doses should not exceed 10,000 IU\n (3000 RAE)/day to avoid possible damage to the fetus or infant.\n Vitamin A Toxicity\n Vitamin A toxicity can be acute (usually due to accidental ingestion by children) or chronic. Both\n types usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes\n nausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal\n liver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Unless birth defects\n are present, adjusting the dose almost always leads to complete recovery.\n Acute vitamin A toxicity in children may result from taking large doses (&gt; 100,000 RAE [&gt; 300,000 IU]),\n usually accidentally. In adults, acute toxicity has occurred when arctic explorers ingested polar bear or\n seal livers, which contain several million units of vitamin A.\n Chronic toxicity in older children and adults usually develops after doses of &gt; 30,000 RAE (&gt; 100,000\n IU)/day have been taken for months. Megavitamin therapy is a possible cause, as are massive daily\n doses (50,000 to 120,000 RAE [150,000 to 350,000 IU]) of vitamin A or its metabolites, which are\n sometimes given for nodular acne or other skin disorders. Adults who consume &gt; 1500 RAE (&gt; 4500\n IU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000\n RAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks. Birth\n defects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment\n during pregnancy.\n Although carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes\n carotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia,\n in which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \u03b2-carotene has been associated with\n increased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and\n vegetables.\n Symptoms and Signs\n Although symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute\n toxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and\n vomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\n Early symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry,\n rough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized\n weakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children.\n Fractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly. In children, toxicity can cause pruritus, anorexia, and\n failure to thrive. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may occur.\n In carotenodermia, the skin (but not the sclera) becomes deep yellow, especially on the palms and soles.\n Diagnosis\n \u2022 Clinical evaluation\n Diagnosis is clinical. Blood vitamin levels correlate poorly with toxicity. However, if clinical diagnosis is\n equivocal, laboratory testing may help. In vitamin A toxicity, fasting serum retinol levels may increase from\n normal (28 to 86 \u03bcg/dL [1 to 3 \u03bcmol/L]) to &gt; 100 \u03bcg/dL (&gt; 3.49 \u03bcmol/L), sometimes to &gt; 2000 \u03bcg/dL (&gt; 69.8\n \u03bcmol/L). Hypercalcemia is common.\n                                                                                                       84",

Prolonged daily administration of large doses, especially to infants, must be avoided because toxicity may result.\n\nFor pregnant or breastfeeding women, prophylactic or therapeutic doses should not exceed 10,000 IU (3000 RAE)/day to avoid possible damage to the fetus or infant.\n\n# Vitamin A Toxicity\n\nVitamin A toxicity can be acute (usually due to accidental ingestion by children) or chronic. Both types usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes nausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal liver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Unless birth defects are present, adjusting the dose almost always leads to complete recovery.\n\nAcute vitamin A toxicity in children may result from taking large doses (&amp;gt; 100,000 RAE [&amp;gt; 300,000 IU]), usually accidentally. In adults, acute toxicity has occurred when arctic explorers ingested polar bear or seal livers, which contain several million units of vitamin A.\n\nChronic toxicity in older children and adults usually develops after doses of &amp;gt; 30,000 RAE (&amp;gt; 100,000 IU)/day have been taken for months. Megavitamin therapy is a possible cause, as are massive daily doses (50,000 to 120,000 RAE [150,000 to 350,000 IU]) of vitamin A or its metabolites, which are sometimes given for nodular acne or other skin disorders. Adults who consume &amp;gt; 1500 RAE (&amp;gt; 4500 IU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000 RAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks. Birth defects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment during pregnancy.\n\nAlthough carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes carotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia, in which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \u03b2-carotene has been associated with increased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and vegetables.\n\n# Symptoms and Signs\n\nAlthough symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute toxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\n\nEarly symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry, rough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized weakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children. Fractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly. In children, toxicity can cause pruritus, anorexia, and failure to thrive. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may occur.\n\nIn carotenodermia, the skin (but not the sclera) becomes deep yellow, especially on the palms and soles.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n- Clinical evaluation\n\nDiagnosis is clinical. Blood vitamin levels correlate poorly with toxicity. However, if clinical diagnosis is equivocal, laboratory testing may help. In vitamin A toxicity, fasting serum retinol levels may increase from normal (28 to 86 \u03bcg/dL [1 to 3 \u03bcmol/L]) to &amp;gt; 100 \u03bcg/dL (&amp;gt; 3.49 \u03bcmol/L), sometimes to &amp;gt; 2000 \u03bcg/dL (&amp;gt; 69.8 \u03bcmol/L). Hypercalcemia is common.",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency &amp; Toxicity\n Differentiating vitamin A toxicity from other disorders may be difficult.

Symptoms and signs of chronic toxicity\n usually disappear within 1 to 4 wk. However, birth defects in the fetus of a mother who has taken\n megadoses of vitamin A are not reversible.\n Treatment\n Vitamin A is stopped.\n Vitamin B6\n Vitamin B6 includes a group of closely related compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine.

Vitamin B6 is important in heme and nucleic acid\n biosynthesis and in lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism.\n Vitamin B6 Deficiency and Dependency\n Because vitamin B6 is present in most foods, dietary deficiency is rare. Secondary deficiency\n may result from various conditions. Symptoms can include peripheral neuropathy, a pellagra-\n like syndrome, anemia, and seizures, which, particularly in infants, may not resolve when\n treated with anticonvulsants.

Breastfed babies of vegan\n mothers may develop vitamin B12 deficiency by age 4 to 6 mo because their\n [\n Table 4-5. Causes of Vitamin B12 Deficiency]\n liver stores (which are normally extensive) are limited and their rapid growth rate results in high demand.\n Vitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption (see Table 4-5 and p. 153), which, in\n the elderly, most commonly results from decreased acid secretion. In such cases, crystalline vitamin B12\n (such as that available in vitamin supplements) can be absorbed, but food-bound vitamin B12 is not\n liberated and absorbed normally. Inadequate absorption may occur in blind loop syndrome (with\n overgrowth of bacteria) or fish tapeworm infestation; in these cases, bacteria or parasites use ingested\n vitamin B12 so that less is available for absorption. Vitamin B12 absorption may be inadequate if ileal\n absorptive sites are destroyed by inflammatory bowel disease or are surgically removed. Less common\n causes of inadequate vitamin B12 absorption include chronic pancreatitis, gastric surgery, malabsorption\n syndromes, AIDS, use of certain drugs (eg, antacids, metformin), repeated exposure to nitrous oxide, and\n a genetic disorder causing malabsorption in the ileum (Imerslund-Graesbeck syndrome).\n Pernicious anemia is often used synonymously with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, pernicious\n anemia specifically refers to anemia resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency caused by an autoimmune\n metaplastic atrophic gastritis with loss of intrinsic factor (see p. 133). Patients with classic pernicious\n anemia, most commonly younger adults, are at increased risk of stomach and other GI cancers.\n Subacute combined degeneration refers to degenerative changes in the nervous system due to\n vitamin B12 deficiency; they affect mostly brain and spinal cord white matter. Demyelinating or axonal\n peripheral neuropathies can occur.\n Symptoms and Signs\n Anemia usually develops insidiously. It is often more severe than its symptoms indicate because its slow\n evolution allows physiologic adaptation. Occasionally, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur. Various GI\n symptoms, including weight loss and poorly localized abdominal pain, may occur. Glossitis, usually\n described as burning of the tongue, is uncommon.\n Neurologic symptoms develop independently from and often without hematologic abnormalities. In early\n stages, decreased position and vibratory sensation in the extremities is accompanied by mild to moderate\n weakness and hyporeflexia. In later stages, spasticity, extensor plantar responses, greater loss of position\n and vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, and ataxia emerge. These deficits may develop in a\n stocking-glove distribution. Tactile, pain, and temperature sensations are usually spared but may be\n difficult to assess in the elderly.\n Some patients are also irritable and mildly depressed. Paranoia (megaloblastic madness), delirium,\n confusion, spastic ataxia, and, at times, postural hypotension may occur in advanced cases. The\n confusion may be difficult to differentiate from age-related dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n Diagnosis\n \u2022 CBC and vitamin B12 and folate levels\n \u2022 Sometimes methylmalonic acid levels or Schilling test\n                                                                                                      87",

A vitamin B12 level &lt; 200 pg/mL (&lt; 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\n The folate level is measured because vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency\n as a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and may\n alleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\n When clinical judgment suggests vitamin B12 deficiency but the vitamin B12 level is low-normal (200 to\n 350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring\n serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B12\n deficiency but may be due to renal failure.

This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test\n measures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B12. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 is given orally, followed\n in 1 to 6 h by 1000 \u03bcg (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B12, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin\n B12 by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B12 is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The\n amount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B12 is determined. If\n absorption is normal, \u2265 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (&lt; 5% if\n kidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B12 absorption. Improved absorption with the\n subsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B12 confirms the diagnosis of pernicious\n anemia. The test is often difficult to do or interpret because of incomplete urine collection or renal\n insufficiency. In addition, because the Schilling test does not measure absorption of protein-bound vitamin\n B12, the test does not detect defective liberation of vitamin B12 from foods, which is common among the\n elderly. The Schilling test repletes vitamin B12 and can mask deficiency, so it should be done only after all\n other diagnostic tests and therapeutic trials.\n If malabsorption is identified, the Schilling test can be repeated after a 2-wk trial of an oral antibiotic.

A vitamin B12 level &amp;lt; 200 pg/mL (&amp;lt; 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\nThe folate level is measured because vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency as a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B12 deficiency and may alleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\n\nWhen clinical judgment suggests vitamin B12 deficiency but the vitamin B12 level is low-normal (200 to 350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B12 deficiency but may be due to renal failure. MMA levels can also be used to monitor the response to treatment. MMA levels remain normal in folate deficiency; homocysteine levels may be elevated with either vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Less commonly, holotranscobalamin II (transcobalamin II-B12 complex) content is measured; when holotranscobalamin II is &amp;lt; 40 pg/mL (&amp;lt; 30 pmol/L), vitamin B12 is deficient.\n\nAfter deficiency is diagnosed, additional tests may be indicated for younger adults but usually not for the elderly. Unless dietary vitamin B12 is obviously inadequate, measurement of serum gastrin levels or autoantibodies to intrinsic factor may be done; sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be poor.",

This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test measures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B12. Radiolabeled vitamin B12 is given orally, followed in 1 to 6 h by 1000 \u03bcg (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B12, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin B12 by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B12 is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The amount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B12 is determined. If absorption is normal, \u2265 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (&amp;lt; 5% if kidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B12 absorption. Improved absorption with the subsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B12 confirms the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. The test is often difficult to do or interpret because of incomplete urine collection or renal insufficiency. In addition, because the Schilling test does not measure absorption of protein-bound vitamin B12, the test does not detect defective liberation of vitamin B12 from foods, which is common among the elderly. The Schilling test repletes vitamin B12 and can mask deficiency, so it should be done only after all other diagnostic tests and therapeutic trials.\n\nIf malabsorption is identified, the Schilling test can be repeated after a 2-wk trial of an oral antibiotic. If antibiotic therapy corrects malabsorption, the likely cause is intestinal overgrowth of bacteria (eg, blind-loop syndrome).",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency &amp; Toxicity\n \u2022 Usually, skin or gingival findings and risk factors\n Diagnosis is usually made clinically in a patient who has skin or gingival signs and is at risk of vitamin C\n deficiency. Laboratory confirmation may be available. Anemia is common. Bleeding, coagulation, and PT\n are normal.\n Skeletal x-rays can help diagnose childhood (but not adult) scurvy. Changes are most evident at the ends\n of long bones, particularly at the knee. Early changes resemble atrophy. Loss of trabeculae results in a\n ground-glass appearance. The cortex thins. A line of calcified, irregular cartilage (white line of Fraenkel)\n may be visible at the metaphysis. A zone of rarefaction or a linear fracture proximal and parallel to the\n white line may be visible as only a triangular defect at the bone's lateral margin but is specific. The\n epiphysis may be compressed. Healing subperiosteal hemorrhages may elevate and calcify the\n periosteum.\n Laboratory diagnosis, which requires measuring blood ascorbic acid, is sometimes done at academic\n centers. Levels of &lt; 0.6 mg/dL (&lt; 34 \u03bcmol/L) are considered marginal; levels of &lt; 0.2 mg/dL (&lt; 11 \u03bcmol/L)\n indicate vitamin C deficiency. Measurement of ascorbic acid levels in the WBC-platelet layer of\n centrifuged blood is not widely available or standardized.\n In adults, scurvy must be differentiated from arthritis, hemorrhagic disorders, gingivitis, and protein-energy\n undernutrition. Hyperkeratotic hair follicles with surrounding hyperemia or hemorrhage are almost\n pathognomonic. Bleeding gums, conjunctival hemorrhages, most petechiae, and ecchymoses are\n nonspecific.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Nutritious diet with supplemental ascorbic acid\n For scurvy in adults, ascorbic acid 100 to 500 mg po tid is given for 1 to 2 wk, until signs disappear, and\n followed by a nutritious diet supplying 1 to 2 times the daily recommended intake. In scurvy, therapeutic\n doses of ascorbic acid restore the functions of vitamin C in a few days. The symptoms and signs usually\n disappear over 1 to 2 wk. Chronic gingivitis with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage persists longer.\n Prevention\n Vitamin C 75 mg po once/day for women and 90 mg po once/day for men prevents deficiency. Smokers\n should consume an additional 35 mg/day. Five servings of most fruits and vegetables (recommended\n daily) provide &gt; 200 mg of vitamin C.\n Vitamin C Toxicity\n The upper limit for vitamin C intake is 2000 mg/day. Up to 10 g/day of vitamin C are sometimes taken for\n unproven health benefits, such as preventing or shortening the duration of viral infections or slowing or\n reversing the progression of cancer or atherosclerosis. Such doses may acidify the urine, cause nausea\n and diarrhea, interfere with the healthy antioxidant-prooxidant balance in the body, and, in patients with\n thalassemia or hemochromatosis, promote iron overload. Intake below the upper limit does not have toxic\n effects in healthy adults.\n Vitamin D\n Vitamin D has 2 main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol); the latter is the naturally\n occurring form and the form used for low-dose supplementation. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in skin by\n exposure to direct sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation) and obtained in the diet chiefly in fish liver oils and salt\n water fish. In some developed countries, milk and other foods are fortified with vitamin D. Human breast\n milk is low in vitamin D, containing an average of only 10% of the amount in fortified cow's milk.\n Requirements for vitamin D increase with age because skin synthesis declines. Sunscreen use and dark\n skin pigmentation also reduce skin synthesis of vitamin D.\n                                                                                                        90",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency &amp; Toxicity\n Vitamin D is a prohormone with several active metabolites that act as hormones. Vitamin D is metabolized\n by the liver to 25(OH)D, which is then converted by the kidneys to 1,25(OH)2D (1,25-\n dihydroxycholecalciferol, calcitriol, or active vitamin D hormone). 25(OH)D, the major circulating form, has\n some metabolic activity, but 1,25(OH)2D is the most metabolically active. The conversion to 1,25(OH)2D\n is regulated by its own concentration, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and serum concentrations of Ca and\n phosphate.\n [\n Table 4-6. Actions of Vitamin D and its Metabolites]\n Vitamin D affects many organ systems (see Table 4-6), but mainly it increases Ca and phosphate\n absorption from the intestine and promotes normal bone formation and mineralization. Vitamin D and\n related analogs may be used to treat psoriasis, hypoparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and possibly\n leukemia and breast, prostate, and colon cancers; they may also be used for immunosuppression.\n Vitamin D Deficiency and Dependency\n Inadequate exposure to sunlight predisposes to vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency impairs bone\n mineralization, causing rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults and possibly contributing\n to osteoporosis. Treatment usually consists of oral vitamin D; Ca and phosphate are\n supplemented as needed. Prevention is often possible. Rarely, hereditary disorders cause\n impaired metabolism of vitamin D (dependency).\n Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of rickets and osteomalacia, but these disorders may also result\n from other conditions, such as various renal tubular disorders, familial hypophosphatemic (vitamin D-\n resistant) rickets (see p. 2991), chronic metabolic acidosis, hypoparathyroidism (which reduces vitamin D\n absorption), inadequate dietary Ca, and disorders or drugs that impair the mineralization of bone matrix.\n Vitamin D deficiency causes hypocalcemia, which stimulates production of PTH, causing\n hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism increases absorption, bone mobilization, and renal\n conservation of Ca but increases excretion of phosphate. As a result, the serum level of Ca may be\n normal, but because of hypophosphatemia, bone mineralization is impaired.\n Etiology\n Vitamin D deficiency may result from the following.\n Inadequate exposure or intake: Inadequate direct sunlight exposure (or sunscreen use) and\n inadequate intake usually occur simultaneously to result in clinical deficiency. Susceptible people include\n the elderly (who are often undernourished and are not exposed to enough sunlight), and certain\n communities (eg, women and children who are confined to the home or who wear clothing that covers the\n entire body and face). Inadequate vitamin D stores are common among the elderly, particularly those who\n are house-bound, institutionalized, or hospitalized or who have had a hip fracture. Recommended direct\n sunlight exposure is 5 to 15 min (suberythemal dose) to arms and legs, or face, arms and hands, at least\n 3 times a week.\n Reduced absorption: Malabsorption can deprive the body of dietary vitamin D; only a small amount of\n 25(OH)D is recirculated enterohepatically.\n Abnormal metabolism: Vitamin D deficiency may result from defects in the production of 25(OH)D or\n 1,25(OH)2D.

Recommended direct sunlight exposure is 5 to 15 min (suberythemal dose) to arms and legs, or face, arms and hands, at least 3 times a week.\n- Reduced absorption: Malabsorption can deprive the body of dietary vitamin D; only a small amount of 25(OH)D is recirculated enterohepatically.\n- Abnormal metabolism: Vitamin D deficiency may result from defects in the production of 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)2D. People with a chronic renal disorder commonly develop rickets or osteomalacia because renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is decreased and phosphate levels are elevated. Hepatic dysfunction can also interfere with production of active vitamin D metabolites.\n- Type I hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets: is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by absent or defective conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D in the kidneys.

Kidney damage or metastatic calcifications, if present, may be irreversible.\n\n# Vitamin E\n\nVitamin E is a group of compounds (including tocopherols and tocotrienols) that have similar biologic activities. The most biologically active is \u03b1-tocopherol, but \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-tocopherols, 4 tocotrienols, and several stereoisomers may also have important biologic activity. These compounds act as antioxidants, which prevent lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes. Plasma tocopherol levels vary with total plasma lipid levels. Normally, the plasma \u03b1-tocopherol level is 5 to 20 \u03bcg/mL (11.6 to 46.4 \u03bcmol/L). High-dose vitamin E supplements do not protect against cardiovascular disorders; whether",

In adults, vitamin E deficiency is suggested if the \u03b1-tocopherol level is &lt; 5 \u03bcg/mL (&lt; 11.6 \u03bcmol/L). Because abnormal lipid levels can affect vitamin E status, a low ratio of serum \u03b1-tocopherol to lipids (&lt; 0.8 mg/g total lipid) is the most accurate indicator in adults with hyperlipidemia.\n\nIn children and adults with abetalipoproteinemia, serum \u03b1-tocopherol levels are usually undetectable.",

Mineral Deficiency and Toxicity\n Introduction\n Six macrominerals are required by people in gram amounts. Four (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) are cations; two (Cl\n and P) are accompanying anions (see p. 820). Daily requirements range from 0.3 to 2.0 g. Bone, muscle,\n heart, and brain function depend on these minerals.\n Nine trace minerals (microminerals) are required by people in minute amounts: chromium, copper, iodine,\n iron, fluorine, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc. (For sources, functions, effects of deficiency\n and toxicity, and dietary requirements, see\n Tables 5-1 and\n 5-2.) All trace minerals are toxic at high levels; some minerals (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may be\n carcinogens.\n Mineral deficiencies (except of iodine, iron, and zinc) do not often develop spontaneously in adults on\n ordinary diets; infants are more vulnerable because their growth is rapid and intake varies. Trace mineral\n imbalances can result from hereditary disorders (eg, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease), kidney dialysis,\n parenteral nutrition, or restrictive diets prescribed for people with inborn errors of metabolism.\n Chromium\n Only 1 to 3% of biologically active trivalent chromium (Cr) is absorbed. Normal plasma levels are 0.05 to\n 0.50 \u03bcg/L (1.0 to 9.6 nmol/L). Chromium potentiates insulin activity and increases the growth rate in\n undernourished children. Supplements do not enhance muscle size or strength in men.\n Deficiency: Four patients receiving long-term TPN developed possible chromium deficiency, with\n glucose intolerance, weight loss, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms resolved in 3 who were\n given trivalent chromium 150 to 250 mg.\n Toxicity: High doses of trivalent chromium given parenterally cause skin irritation, but lower doses given\n orally are not toxic. Exposure to hexavalent chromium (CrO3) in the workplace may irritate the skin, lungs,\n and GI tract and may cause perforation of the nasal septum and lung carcinoma.\n Copper\n Copper is a component of many body proteins; almost all of the body's copper is bound to copper\n proteins. Unbound (free) copper ions are toxic. Genetic mechanisms control the incorporation of copper\n into apoproteins and the processes that prevent toxic accumulation of copper in the body. Copper\n absorbed in excess of metabolic requirements is excreted through bile.\n [Table 5-1. Trace Minerals]\n Acquired Copper Deficiency\n If the genetic mechanisms controlling copper metabolism are normal, dietary deficiency rarely causes\n clinically significant copper deficiency. The only reported causes are kwashiorkor, persistent infantile\n diarrhea (usually associated with a diet limited to milk), severe malabsorption (as in sprue), and excessive\n zinc intake.\n Deficiency may cause neutropenia, impaired bone calcification, and hypochromic anemia not responsive\n to iron supplements.\n Diagnosis is based on low serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, although these tests are not always\n reliable. Treatment is directed at the cause, and copper 1.5 to 3 mg/day po (usually as copper sulfate) is\n given.\n                                                                                                       99",

Mineral Deficiency &amp; Toxicity\n Inherited Copper Deficiency\n (Menkes Syndrome)\n Inherited copper deficiency occurs in male infants who inherit a mutant X-linked gene. Incidence is about\n 1 in 50,000 live births. Copper is deficient in the liver, serum, and essential copper proteins, including\n cytochrome-c oxidase, ceruloplasmin, and lysyl oxidase.\n Symptoms are severe intellectual disability, vomiting, diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy,\n hypopigmentation, bone changes, and arterial rupture; the hair is sparse, steely, or kinky.\n Diagnosis\n \u2022 Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels\n \u2022 Serum levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and dihydroxyphenylglycol in\n   infants at risk\n Diagnosis is based on low copper and ceruloplasmin levels in serum, although these tests are not always\n reliable. Because early diagnosis and treatment seem to result in a better prognosis, the disorder is\n ideally detected before age 2 wk. However, diagnostic accuracy of these tests is limited. Thus, infants at\n risk (eg, those with a family history) can be screened by measuring dopamine, norepinephrine,\n dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and dihydroxyphenylglycol in serum. A dihydroxyphenylacetic\n acid:dihydroxyphenylglycol ratio of &gt; 4 seems to indicate deficiency, and a dopamine:norepinephrine ratio\n of &gt; 0.2 seems to confirm it.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Copper histidine\n Parenteral copper is usually given as copper histidine 250 \u03bcg sc bid to age 1 yr, then 250 \u03bcg sc once/day\n until age 3 yr; monitoring kidney function is essential during treatment. Despite early treatment, many\n children have abnormal neurodevelopment.\n Acquired Copper Toxicity\n Acquired copper toxicity can result from ingesting or absorbing excess copper (eg, from ingesting an\n acidic food or beverage that has had prolonged contact with a copper container). Self-limited\n gastroenteritis with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.\n [Table 5-2. Guidelines for Daily Intake of Minerals]\n More severe toxicity results from ingestion (usually with suicidal intent) of gram quantities of a copper salt\n (eg, copper sulfate) or from absorption of large amounts through the skin (eg, if compresses saturated\n with a solution of a copper salt are applied to large areas of burned skin). Hemolytic anemia and anuria\n can result and may be fatal.\n Indian childhood cirrhosis, non-Indian childhood cirrhosis, and idiopathic copper toxicity are probably\n identical disorders in which excess copper causes cirrhosis. All seem to be caused by ingesting milk that\n has been boiled or stored in corroded copper or brass vessels. Recent studies suggest that idiopathic\n copper toxicity may develop only in infants with an unknown genetic defect.\n Diagnosis usually requires liver biopsy, which shows Mallory hyalin bodies.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Chelation\n                                                                                                        100",

Despite early treatment, many children have abnormal neurodevelopment.\n\n# Acquired Copper Toxicity\n\nAcquired copper toxicity can result from ingesting or absorbing excess copper (eg, from ingesting an acidic food or beverage that has had prolonged contact with a copper container). Self-limited gastroenteritis with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.\n\n| More severe toxicity results from ingestion (usually with suicidal intent) of gram quantities of a copper salt (eg, copper sulfate) or from absorption of large amounts through the skin (eg, if compresses saturated with a solution of a copper salt are applied to large areas of burned skin).

Mineral Deficiency &amp; Toxicity\n \u2022 Supportive measures\n For copper toxicity due to ingesting grams of copper, prompt gastric lavage is done. Copper toxicity that\n causes complications such as hemolytic anemia, anuria, or hepatotoxicity is also treated with either oral\n penicillamine 250 mg q 6 h to 750 mg q 12 h (1000 to 1500 mg/day in 2 to 4 doses) or dimercaprol 3 to 5\n mg/kg IM q 4 h for 2 days, then q 4 to 6 h (see also\n Table 340-4 and copper salts in\n Table 340-8). If used early, hemodialysis may be effective. Occasionally, copper toxicity is fatal despite\n treatment.\n Inherited Copper Toxicity\n (Wilson's Disease)\n Inherited copper toxicity results in accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. Hepatic\n or neurologic symptoms develop. Diagnosis is based on a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high\n urinary excretion of copper, and sometimes liver biopsy results. Treatment consists of a low-\n copper diet and chelation, usually with penicillamine or dimercaprol.\n Wilson's disease is a progressive disorder of copper metabolism that affects 1 person in 30,000. Affected\n people are homozygous for the mutant recessive gene, located on chromosome 13. Heterozygous\n carriers, who constitute about 1.1% of the population, are asymptomatic.\n Pathophysiology\n The genetic defect impairs copper transport. The impaired transport decreases copper secretion into the\n bile, thus causing the copper overload and resultant accumulation in the liver, which begins at birth. The\n impaired transport also interferes with incorporation of copper into the copper protein ceruloplasmin, thus\n decreasing serum levels of ceruloplasmin.\n Hepatic fibrosis develops, ultimately causing cirrhosis. Copper diffuses out of the liver into the blood, then\n into other tissues. It is most destructive to the brain but also damages the kidneys and reproductive\n organs and causes hemolytic anemia. Some copper is deposited in Descemet's membrane of the cornea,\n causing Kayser-Fleischer rings.\n Symptoms and Signs\n Symptoms usually develop between ages 5 and 40. In almost half of patients, particularly adolescents,\n the first symptom is hepatitis\u2014acute, chronic active, or fulminant. But hepatitis may develop at any time.\n In about 40% of patients, particularly young adults, the first symptoms reflect CNS involvement. Motor\n deficits are common, including any combination of tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, chorea,\n drooling, and incoordination.

Mineral Deficiency &amp; Toxicity\n \u2022 A sibling, parent, or cousin with Wilson's disease\n \u2022 Fulminant hepatitis\n If Wilson's disease is suspected, slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings is required, and serum\n ceruloplasmin and copper levels and 24-h urinary copper excretion are measured. Transaminase levels\n are also often measured; high levels are consistent with the diagnosis.\n Kayser-Fleischer rings: These rings plus typical motor neurologic abnormalities or a decrease in\n ceruloplasmin are nearly pathognomonic for Wilson's disease. Rarely, these rings occur in other liver\n disorders (eg, biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis), but ceruloplasmin levels should be unaffected.\n Ceruloplasmin: Serum ceruloplasmin (normally 20 to 35 mg/dL) is usually low in Wilson's disease but\n can be normal. It can also be low in heterozygous carriers and those with other liver disorders (eg, viral\n hepatitis, drug- or alcohol-induced liver disease). A low ceruloplasmin level in a patient with a Kayser-\n Fleischer ring is diagnostic. Also, a level of &lt; 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive regardless of clinical findings.\n Serum copper: Despite the copper accumulation in the body, serum copper levels are decreased\n because of the decreased ceruloplasmin levels.\n Urinary copper excretion: In Wilson's disease, 24-h urinary copper excretion (normally, \u2264 30 \u03bcg/day) is\n usually &gt; 100 \u03bcg/day. If serum ceruloplasmin is low and urinary copper excretion is high, diagnosis is\n clear. If levels are equivocal, measuring urinary copper excretion after penicillamine is given\n (penicillamine provocation test) may confirm the diagnosis; this test is not usually done in adults because\n cutoff values are not well-established.\n Liver biopsy: In unclear cases (eg, elevated transaminases, no Kayser-Fleischer rings, indeterminate\n values for ceruloplasmin and urinary copper), the diagnosis is made by doing a liver biopsy to measure\n hepatic copper concentration. However, false-negative results may occur because of a sampling error\n (due to large variations in copper concentrations in the liver) or fulminant hepatitis (causing necrosis that\n releases large amounts of copper).\n Screening: Because early treatment is most effective, screening is indicated for anyone who has a\n sibling, cousin, or parent with Wilson's disease. Screening consists of a slit-lamp examination and\n measurement of transaminase levels, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine copper excretion.\n If any results are abnormal, liver biopsy is done to measure hepatic copper concentration. Infants should\n not be tested until after age 1 yr because ceruloplasmin levels are low during the first few months of life.\n Children &lt; 6 yr with normal test results should be retested 5 to 10 yr later.\n Genetic testing is under investigation.\n Prognosis\n Prognosis is usually good, unless disease is advanced before treatment begins. Untreated Wilson's\n disease is fatal, usually by age 30.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Penicillamine or another chelating drug if needed to remove accumulated copper\n \u2022 Low-copper diet\n \u2022 For maintenance, lifelong low-dose chelation therapy or oral zinc\n Continual, lifelong treatment is mandatory regardless of whether symptoms are present.

Transaminase levels are also often measured; high levels are consistent with the diagnosis.\n\n# Kayser-Fleischer rings:\n\nThese rings plus typical motor neurologic abnormalities or a decrease in ceruloplasmin are nearly pathognomonic for Wilson's disease. Rarely, these rings occur in other liver disorders (eg, biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis), but ceruloplasmin levels should be unaffected.\n\n# Ceruloplasmin:\n\nSerum ceruloplasmin (normally 20 to 35 mg/dL) is usually low in Wilson's disease but can be normal. It can also be low in heterozygous carriers and those with other liver disorders (eg, viral hepatitis, drug- or alcohol-induced liver disease). A low ceruloplasmin level in a patient with a Kayser-Fleischer ring is diagnostic. Also, a level of &lt; 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive regardless of clinical findings.\n\n# Serum copper:\n\nDespite the copper accumulation in the body, serum copper levels are decreased because of the decreased ceruloplasmin levels.\n\n# Urinary copper excretion:\n\nIn Wilson's disease, 24-h urinary copper excretion (normally, \u2264 30 \u03bcg/day) is usually &gt; 100 \u03bcg/day. If serum ceruloplasmin is low and urinary copper excretion is high, diagnosis is clear. If levels are equivocal, measuring urinary copper excretion after penicillamine is given (penicillamine provocation test) may confirm the diagnosis; this test is not usually done in adults because cutoff values are not well-established.\n\n# Liver biopsy:\n\nIn unclear cases (eg, elevated transaminases, no Kayser-Fleischer rings, indeterminate values for ceruloplasmin and urinary copper), the diagnosis is made by doing a liver biopsy to measure hepatic copper concentration. However, false-negative results may occur because of a sampling error (due to large variations in copper concentrations in the liver) or fulminant hepatitis (causing necrosis that releases large amounts of copper).\n\n# Screening:\n\nBecause early treatment is most effective, screening is indicated for anyone who has a sibling, cousin, or parent with Wilson's disease. Screening consists of a slit-lamp examination and measurement of transaminase levels, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine copper excretion. If any results are abnormal, liver biopsy is done to measure hepatic copper concentration. Infants should not be tested until after age 1 yr because ceruloplasmin levels are low during the first few months of life. Children &lt; 6 yr with normal test results should be retested 5 to 10 yr later. Genetic testing is under investigation.\n\n# Prognosis\n\nPrognosis is usually good, unless disease is advanced before treatment begins. Untreated Wilson's disease is fatal, usually by age 30.\n\n# Treatment\n\n\u2022 Penicillamine or another chelating drug if needed to remove accumulated copper\n\n\u2022 Low-copper diet\n\n\u2022 For maintenance, lifelong low-dose chelation therapy or oral zinc\n\nContinual, lifelong treatment is mandatory regardless of whether symptoms are present. Accumulated copper should be removed with chelating drugs. A low-copper diet (eg, avoiding beef liver, cashews, black-eyed peas, vegetable juice, shellfish, mushrooms, and cocoa) and use of either low-dose chelation.",

Cross-reactivity may occur in people with penicillin allergy.\n Patients &gt; 5 yr are given oral doses of 62.5 mg q 6 h to 250 mg q 12 h (250 to 500 mg/day in 2 to 4\n doses) and slowly increased to a maximum of 250 mg q 6 h to 750 mg q 12 h (1000 to 1500 mg/day in 2\n to 4 doses).

Regular follow-up care with an expert in liver disease is recommended.\n Liver transplantation may be lifesaving for patients who have Wilson's disease and fulminant hepatic\n failure or severe hepatic insufficiency refractory to drugs.\n Fluorine\n Most of the body's fluorine (F) is contained in bones and teeth. Fluoride (the ionic form of fluorine) is\n widely distributed in nature. The main source of fluoride is fluoridated drinking water.\n Deficiency: Fluorine deficiency can lead to dental caries and possibly osteoporosis. Fluoridation of\n water that contains &lt; 1 ppm (the ideal) reduces the incidence of dental caries. If a child's drinking water is\n not fluoridated, oral fluoride supplements can be prescribed.\n Toxicity: Excess fluorine can accumulate in teeth and bones, causing fluorosis. Drinking water\n containing &gt; 10 ppm is a common cause. Permanent teeth that develop during high fluoride intake are\n most likely to be affected. Exposure must be much greater to affect deciduous teeth.\n The earliest signs are chalky white, irregularly distributed patches on the surface of the enamel; these\n patches become stained yellow or brown, producing a characteristic mottled appearance. Severe toxicity\n weakens the enamel, pitting its surface. Bony changes, including osteosclerosis, exostoses of the spine,\n and genu valgum, can develop but only in adults after prolonged high intake of fluoride.\n No tests to diagnose toxicity are available.\n Treatment involves reducing fluoride intake; eg, in areas with high fluoride water levels, patients should\n not drink fluoridated water or take fluoride supplements. Children should always be told not to swallow\n fluoridated toothpastes.\n Iodine\n In the body, iodine (I) is involved primarily in the synthesis of 2 thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and\n triiodothyronine (T3).

Mineral Deficiency &amp; Toxicity\n Iodine Deficiency\n Deficiency is rare in areas where iodized salt is used but common worldwide. Iodine deficiency develops\n when iodide intake is &lt; 20 \u03bcg/day. In mild or moderate deficiency, the thyroid gland, influenced by thyroid-\n stimulating hormone (TSH), hypertrophies to concentrate iodide in itself, resulting in colloid goiter.\n Usually, patients remain euthyroid; however, severe iodine deficiency in adults may cause hypothyroidism\n (endemic myxedema). It can decrease fertility and increase risk of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and\n prenatal and infant mortality. Severe maternal iodine deficiency retards fetal growth and brain\n development, sometimes resulting in birth defects, and, in infants, causes cretinism, which may include\n intellectual disability, deaf-mutism, difficulty walking, short stature, and sometimes hypothyroidism.\n Diagnosis\n \u2022 Assessment of thyroid structure and function\n Diagnosis in adults and children is usually based on thyroid function, examination for goiter, and imaging\n tests identifying abnormalities in thyroid function and structure (see p.\n 776). All neonates should be screened by measuring the TSH level.\n Treatment\n \u2022 Iodide with or without levothyroxine\n Infants with iodine deficiency are given L-thyroxine 3 \u03bcg/kg po once/day for a week plus iodide 50 to 90\n \u03bcg po once/day for several weeks to quickly restore a euthyroid state. Children are treated with iodide 90\n to 120 \u03bcg once/day. Adults are given iodide 150 \u03bcg once/day. Iodine deficiency can also be treated by\n giving levothyroxine. Serum TSH levels are monitored in all patients until the levels are normal (ie, &lt; 5\n \u03bcIU/mL).\n Iodine Toxicity\n Chronic toxicity may develop when intake is &gt; 1.1 mg/day. Most people who ingest excess amounts of\n iodine remain euthyroid. Some people who ingest excess amounts of iodine, particularly those who were\n previously deficient, develop hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Paradoxically, excess uptake\n of iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine\n toxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide\n may cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions.\n Patients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also\n need to have their thyroid function monitored.\n Diagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. 776), which are\n correlated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment\n consists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\n Iron\n Iron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body. Heme iron, contained\n mainly in animal products, is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg, in plants and grains), which\n accounts for &gt; 85% of iron in the average diet. However, absorption of nonheme iron is increased when it\n is consumed with animal protein and vitamin C.\n Deficiency: Iron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies in the world. It may result\n from the following:\n \u2022 Inadequate iron intake, common in infants, adolescent girls, and pregnant women\n \u2022 Malabsorption (eg, celiac sprue)\n                                                                                                       104",

Zinc is a component of several hundred enzymes, including many nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenases, RNA and DNA polymerases, and DNA transcription factors as well as alkaline phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and carbonic anhydrase. A diet high in fiber and phytate (eg, in whole-grain bread) reduces zinc absorption.\n\n# Deficiency\n\nDietary deficiency is unlikely in healthy people. Secondary zinc deficiency can develop in the following:\n\n- Some patients with hepatic insufficiency (because the ability to retain zinc is lost)\n- Patients taking diuretics\n- Patients with diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, or malabsorption\n- Patients with stressful conditions (eg, sepsis, burns, head injury)\n- Elderly institutionalized and homebound patients (common)\n\nMaternal zinc deficiency may cause fetal malformations and low birth weight.",

Mineral Deficiency &amp; Toxicity\n Zinc deficiency in children causes impaired growth and impaired taste (hypogeusia). Other symptoms and\n signs in children include delayed sexual maturation and hypogonadism. In children or adults, symptoms\n include hypogonadism, alopecia, impaired immunity, anorexia, dermatitis, night blindness, anemia,\n lethargy, and impaired wound healing.\n Zinc deficiency should be suspected in undernourished patients with typical symptoms or signs. However,\n because many of the symptoms and signs are nonspecific, clinical diagnosis of mild zinc deficiency is\n difficult. Laboratory diagnosis is also difficult. Low albumin levels, common in zinc deficiency, make serum\n zinc levels difficult to interpret; diagnosis usually requires the combination of low levels of zinc in serum\n and increased urinary zinc excretion. If available, isotope studies can measure zinc status more\n accurately.\n Treatment consists of elemental zinc 15 to 120 mg/day po until symptoms and signs resolve.\n Acrodermatitis enteropathica (a rare, once fatal autosomal recessive disorder) causes malabsorption\n of zinc. Psoriasiform dermatitis develops around the eyes, nose, and mouth; on the buttocks; and in an\n acral distribution. The disorder also causes hair loss, paronychia, impaired immunity, recurrent infection,\n impaired growth, and diarrhea. Symptoms and signs usually develop after infants are weaned from breast\n milk. In such cases, doctors suspect the diagnosis. If deficiency is diagnosed, zinc sulfate 30 to 150\n mg/day po usually results in complete remission.\n Toxicity: The recommended upper limit for zinc intake is 40 mg/day. Toxicity is rare. Ingesting doses of\n elemental zinc ranging from 100 to 150 mg/day for prolonged periods interferes with copper metabolism\n and causes low blood copper levels, RBC microcytosis, neutropenia, and impaired immunity; higher\n doses should be given only for short periods of time and the patient should be followed closely.

However, because many of the symptoms and signs are nonspecific, clinical diagnosis of mild zinc deficiency is difficult. Laboratory diagnosis is also difficult.

Psoriasiform dermatitis develops around the eyes, nose, and mouth; on the buttocks; and in an acral distribution. The disorder also causes hair loss, paronychia, impaired immunity, recurrent infection, impaired growth, and diarrhea. Symptoms and signs usually develop after infants are weaned from breast milk. In such cases, doctors suspect the diagnosis.

Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome\n Obesity\n Obesity is excess body fat; consequences depend not only on the absolute amount but also on\n the distribution of the fat. Complications include cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus,\n many cancers, cholelithiasis, fatty liver and cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, reproductive disorders in\n men and women, psychologic disorders, and premature death. Diagnosis is based on body\n mass index (BMI\u2014calculated from height and weight) and waist circumference. BP, fasting\n plasma glucose, and lipid levels should be measured. Treatment includes physical activity,\n dietary and behavioral modification, and sometimes drugs or surgery.\n Prevalence of obesity in the US is high and is increasing, particularly among children and adolescents\n (see\n Table 6-1).\n Prevalence is more than twice as high at age 55 as at age 20. Obesity is twice as common among women\n in a lower socioeconomic group as among those in a higher group. Prevalence among black and white\n men does not differ significantly, but it is higher among black women than white women. More than 50%\n of black women \u2265 40 yr are obese; &gt; 80% are overweight.\n In the US, obesity and its complications cause as many as 300,000 premature deaths each year, making\n it second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death.\n [Table 6-1. Changes in Prevalence of Obesity According to Nhanes]\n Etiology\n Almost all cases of obesity result from a combination of genetic predisposition and a chronic imbalance\n between energy intake, energy utilization for basic metabolic processes, and energy expenditure from\n physical activity.\n Genetic factors: Heritability of BMI is about 66%. Genetic factors may affect the many signaling\n molecules and receptors used by parts of the hypothalamus and GI tract to regulate food intake (see\n Sidebar 6-1). Rarely, obesity results from abnormal levels of peptides that regulate food intake (eg, leptin)\n or abnormalities in their receptors (eg, melanocortin-4 receptor).\n Genetic factors also regulate energy expenditure, including BMR, diet-induced thermogenesis, and\n nonvoluntary activity-associated thermogenesis. Genetic factors may have a greater effect on the\n distribution of body fat, particularly abdominal fat (see Metabolic Syndrome on p. 64), than on the amount\n of body fat.\n Environmental factors: Weight is gained when caloric intake exceeds energy needs. Important\n determinants of energy intake include portion sizes and the energy density of the food. High-fat foods,\n processed foods, and diets high in refined carbohydrates, soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol promote\n weight gain. Diets high in fresh fruit and vegetables, fiber, and complex carbohydrates, with water as the\n main fluid consumed, minimize weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain.\n Regulatory factors: Prenatal maternal obesity, prenatal maternal smoking, intrauterine growth\n restriction, and insufficient sleep can disturb weight regulation. About 15% of women permanently gain \u2265\n 20 lb with each pregnancy. Obesity that persists beyond early childhood makes weight loss in later life\n more difficult.\n Drugs, including corticosteroids, lithium, traditional antidepressants (tricyclics, tetracyclics, and\n monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]), benzodiazepines, and antipsychotic drugs, often cause weight\n gain.\n Uncommonly, weight gain is caused by one of the following disorders:\n                                                                                                     108",

Hemolytic anemia and anuria can result and may be fatal.', '']

['and idiopathic copper toxicity are probably identical disorders in which excess copper causes cirrhosis. All seem to be caused by ingesting milk that has been boiled or stored in corroded copper or brass vessels.

). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56
) and related disorders; excess intake of
micro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much
usaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders. Macronutrients
Macronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids),
macrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as
sources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g). Carbohydrates:
 Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides.

Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body
and thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some
amino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds,
although they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are
required by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts. Lack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p.

Table 1-4. Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes* for Some Macronutrients, Food and Nutrition
Board, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies]
Micronutrients
Vitamins and minerals required in minute amounts (trace minerals) are micronutrients (see 
Chs. 4
 and 
5
).

Water:
 Water is considered a macronutrient because it is required in amounts of 1 mL/kcal (0.24 mL/kJ)
of energy expended, or about 2500 mL/day. Needs vary with fever, physical activity, and changes in
climate and humidity.

Essential Amino Acid Requirements in mg/kg Body Weight]
Requirements for EFAs vary by age. Adults require amounts of linoleic acid equal to at least 2% of total
caloric needs and linolenic acid equal to at least 0.5%. Vegetable oils provide linoleic acid and linolenic
acid. Oils made from safflower, sunflower, corn, soya, primrose, pumpkin, and wheat germ provide large
amounts of linoleic acid. Marine fish oils and oils made from flax-seeds, pumpkin, soy, and canola provide
large amounts of linolenic acid. Marine fish oils also provide some other 
ω
-3 fatty acids in large amounts. Macrominerals:
 Na, Cl, K, Ca, P, and Mg are required in relatively large amounts per day (see
Tables 1-3
,
1-4
, and
5-2
).

<p>In this section, we focus on developing an intelligent Nutrition Disorder Specialist agent that can provide accurate and context-aware responses. We start by building an Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent Tool, which involves importing necessary libraries, defining the agent's state, expanding queries for better retrieval, and fetching relevant information from the vector store. We then generate responses based on the retrieved context and evaluate their groundedness and precision. If needed, we refine the responses and queries to ensure high-quality outputs. Additionally, we guardrail user input using Llama Guard to ensure safe interactions. Finally, we initialize and run the AI Nutrition Disorder Specialist agent, enabling it to answer nutrition disorder-related questions effectively and safely. This comprehensive setup equips the agent with advanced retrieval mechanisms and ensures safe and informative user interactions.</p>

Suggestions: 1. Specify the age groups more clearly by using terms like "pediatric" for children and "adult" for adults.
2. Include "clinical manifestations" instead of "common clinical symptoms" for precision.
3. Add "pathophysiological implications" to encompass health consequences.
4. Mention specific populations if relevant, such as "at-risk populations" or "elderly."
5. Consider including "diagnosis" or "assessment" to focus on clinical evaluation.
6. Include "epidemiology" to address prevalence and risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency.
7. Use "vitamin D insufficiency" along with "deficiency" to capture a broader range of literature.

Suggestions: 1. Specify the types of vitamins (e.g., fat-soluble, water-soluble) to narrow down the search context.
2. Include specific health conditions or deficiencies associated with each vitamin to enhance relevance.
3. Use medical terminology (e.g., "hypovitaminosis" for deficiencies) for clarity.
4. Consider adding "clinical implications" to focus on the health consequences in a medical context.
5. Clarify if the search is for human health or other species to avoid ambiguity.

Suggestions: 1. Specify the types of vitamins by including "vitamin classification" to clarify the focus on fat-soluble and water-soluble categories.
2. Include "mechanisms of action" alongside "physiological functions" to enhance the understanding of how vitamins operate in the body.
3. Use "clinical consequences" instead of "clinical implications" for clearer terminology regarding the effects of hypovitaminosis.
4. Replace "associated health conditions" with "specific health disorders" to target particular medical conditions linked to deficiencies.
5. Consider adding "treatment options" for hypovitaminosis to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical management.
6. Clarify "deficiencies" by specifying "nutritional deficiencies" to emphasize the context of vitamin insufficiency.
